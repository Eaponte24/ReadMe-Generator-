# Rickys ReadMe Generator

## Description

I've created a quick and easy way to generate a ReadMe Markdown file all from within Node.JS. With this program, you'll be able to easilly create a professional Readme for your project you've been working on. It will also provide the user who is reading the file to easily find your contact information if they have any quewstions regarding your project.

## Usage

When using my ReadMe Generator, all you have to do is open up the terminal and type Node index and the generator will prompt you with questions regarding your ReadMe that you will be creating. You will see in the screenshots provided as well as the video provided of an example of how to use the program that you will have to answer questions based off how a professional ReadME should look!.

## Features

Some features that I've added to this program are when you choose a license from the list you given, in the ReadMe you are given a badge for that license as well as a link that brings you to that license. Also another feature that I've included in my program is the table of contents feature. When the ReadMe is generated, the table of contents links will bring you to each section of the ReadMe. Lastly, ive added a questions section so that if anyone has questions about your Readme they can contact you there!
